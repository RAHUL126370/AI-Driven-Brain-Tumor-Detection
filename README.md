# AI-Driven-Brain-Tumor-Detection
**Project Overview**

Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions that require early detection for effective treatment. This project aims to develop an AI-powered Brain Tumor Detection System using deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG16 model, to classify brain tumors from MRI scans into different categories.

**Features**

1. Deep Learning Model: Uses VGG16 for image classification.
2. High Accuracy: Achieves over 90% accuracy in tumor classification.
3. Web-Based Interface: Allows users to upload MRI scans and receive instant classification results.
4. Flask API: Enables seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.


**Technologies Used**

1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask
3. Deep Learning Model: VGG16 (Pre-trained with Transfer Learning)
4. Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
5. IDE: PyCharm

**Dataset Used**

The dataset consists of labeled MRI images categorized into:

1. Glioma
2. Meningioma
3. Pituitary
4. Normal


**Project Workflow**

1. Data Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. Model Training: Fine-tuning VGG16 using a labeled dataset.
3. Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
4. Deployment: Flask-based web app for real-time prediction.
